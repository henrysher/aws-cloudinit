# Versions of boto >= 2.6.0 (and possibly 2.5.2)
# try to lazily load the metadata backing, which
# doesn't work so well in cloud-init especially
# since the metadata is serialized and actions are
# performed where the metadata server may be blocked
# (thus the datasource will start failing) resulting
# in url exceptions when fields that do exist (or
# would have existed) do not exist due to the blocking
# that occurred.

# TODO(harlowja): https://github.com/boto/boto/issues/1401
# When boto finally moves to using requests, we should be able
# to provide it ssl details, it does not yet, so we can't provide them...
